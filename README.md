# TestPhilosopher

This program completes the classic Dining Philosophers problem using Java programming. As it works, 5 philiosophers sitting in at a table. In order for the philosopher to eat, they must pick up the fork on the left and right. This causes overlay since the forks and shared between a philosopher on the left and right. Basically this program makes a thread for every philosopher so that each of the objects can run simultaneously without waiting for other functions and objects to complete. Here this programs never stops running, unless a deadlock occurs.
